# PlayStation Captures

A small web app to download your PlayStation 5 game captures.

## Backstory

So, the PlayStation App SUCKS!!! The frustration started when I could not
download my capture where I recorded myself web-swinging through the city in
Spider-Man 2. Like every normal guy, I searched the internet on how to fix this
and to my surprise, Reddit was filled with people asking the same question for
the last 3 years with no solution. So I had to take things into my own hands
and fix it for me (and the community ðŸ˜„)
